    "content": "Jawi script developed concurrently with the arrival of Islam in the Malay Archipelago around the 13th century. The oldest evidence of its use is found on the Terengganu Inscription Stone, dated 1303 AD. The script reached its peak from the 17th to the early 20th century, used in royal administration, literature, and education before its role was largely replaced by the Rumi (Latin) script."

    "content": "Most Jawi letters can be connected at the beginning, middle, and end of a word. However, some letters cannot be connected to the letter that follows them: Alif (ا), Wau (و), Va (ۏ), Dal (د), Zal (ذ), Ra (ر), and Zai (ز). After these letters, the word is 'broken,' and the next letter is written in its isolated form."
